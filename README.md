# Ugliest CSS

Ugliest CSS is now live on the web, using GitHub pages! [Check it out here!](http://krafalski.github.io/ugliestcss/)

This is a repo for people to try out GitHub, get familiar with working on a collaboration, and have fun with CSS.

Fork or clone this repo, then create your own CSS file, link it in the index.html, then merge it back and show off your CSS!

Getting started with GitHub/this project:
[Click here! This is a great resource to follow.](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html)

Once you have your own copy, the index.html has more instructions on how to make your CSS file and link it in the project.
For a sneakpeak of the index.html [go here.](https://github.com/Krafalski/ugliestcss/blob/master/index.html)

This project is brand new! I am looking for all kinds of contributions beyond css! Please feel free to create a GitHub issue, work on a GitHub issue, contribute to the readme and index.html, offer suggestions on how to make this project even better or anything else!

Here is a great article  for absolute beginners and a couple invaluable cheat sheets:
